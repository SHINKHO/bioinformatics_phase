# Git Ignore for a Python Bioinformatics Pipeline with a Flask Interface
#
# This template is designed to ignore large data files, intermediate
# bioinformatics results, Python environment files, and other generated content
# that should not be tracked by Git.

# --- Bioinformatics Data & Results ---
# This is the most important section for your project.
# It prevents large raw data, intermediate files, and final results from being committed.

# 1. Raw sequencing data
# This directory contains the multi-gigabyte FASTQ files you downloaded.
raw_fastq/
*.fastq.gz
*.fq.gz

# 2. Intermediate analysis files
# These directories are created by your pipeline tools and can be very large.
# Add any other intermediate directories your scripts create.
trimmomatic_output/
megahit_output/
metagene_output/
rgi_output/
abricate_output/
*.bam
*.sam
*.bai

# 3. Reference Databases
# Any large database files downloaded for tools like Bowtie2 or RGI/CARD.
databases/
*.fasta
*.fna
*.faa
*.gff
card.json

# 4. Final reports and logs from the pipeline
# While some small reports might be versioned, large ones should be ignored.
pipeline_logs/
*.log
*.tsv
*.csv
# Be specific if you want to track SOME csv/tsv files but not others.
# For example, to ignore only the large RGI output:
# rgi_report.tsv


# --- Python & Flask Specific ---
# Ignores files and directories common to Python and Flask development.

# 1. Virtual Environments
# Never commit your virtual environment.
.venv/
venv/
env/
ENV/
.env

# 2. Python bytecode and caches
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# 3. Flask specific
# The instance folder often contains secrets or database files.
instance/
.flaskenv

# 4. Distribution / packaging
.Python

# --- General Development & OS Specific ---
# Ignores common files generated by operating systems and code editors.

# 1. Operating System generated files

# 2. Editor and IDE configuration

# 3. Miscellaneous
